Golang linting can be done with golangci-lint 
Golang testing can be done with Testify
Golang building can be done with Go's native go tool.
Some alternative to CI/CD with golang that is not Jenkins or Github Actions are Semaphore and Gitlab Runner.
Semaphore is a cloud-based CI/CD platform so this setup is better in a cloud-based environment.
